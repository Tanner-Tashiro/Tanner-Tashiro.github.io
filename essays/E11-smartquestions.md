Software engineering depends greatly on communication with others as it does on code. One of the most important skills for a software engineer is the ability to ask effective questions, questions that are effective and exerts critical thinking upon the reader. Eric Raymond’s guidline, How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, provides a framework for engaging productively with technical communities, particularly in open source environments. The importance of asking “smart” questions by analyzing two examples from Stack Overflow. The first demonstrates how following Raymond’s principles leads to efficient and effective help from the community. The second illustrates how violating those principles results in poor outcomes, such as confusion, frustration, or question closure. By comparing these two cases, I gained a deeper understanding of how question quality directly affects the quality of responses.

Smart questions are important because it shows sign of respect to both the asker's time and the time of the people who offer their help. According to Raymond's guidelines, some indications of a smart question is being clear, describing the goal not the steps, and providing enough information for others to reason about the problem. Asking smart questions are valuable in developing communication skills that allow for, in a professional software development setting, better collaboration, faster debugging, and more efficienct use of time.

## A Smart Question
A strong example of a smart question is: [Why does creating a list of lists produce unexpected behavior?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44915324/why-does-creating-a-list-of-lists-produce-unexpected-behavior).

In this question, the developer is confused by Python behavior when initializing a list of lists. They showed their attempts at creating this structure and demonstrated, with concrete output, that modifying one sub-list unexpectedly affects all others. Following Raymond’s key guidelines, we can see that the developer explicitly states the unexpected behavior and provides a complete segment of code. The asker then compares the two approaches and explains thier reasoning. A key part of asking a smart question, is asking a question that can't just be searched up for the answer; the question should evoke thought and to deeply understand why such behavior occurs.
