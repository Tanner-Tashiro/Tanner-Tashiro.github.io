From when I was young, I was always interested in art and design. Whether that being through drawing, making minecraft builds, or making programs. I've always enjoyed the process of solving problemns through a combination of logic, structure, and creativity. Through my school courses and projects, I have learned not only how to write code that works, but in understanding why it works, how it can be improved, and how it fits into a larger system.

So far, my experiences have exposed me to programming in multiple languages and working with software-oriented systems. Most of my experience has been through solving problems from homework assignments and learning the importance of foundational concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and etc. Overtime, I have also learned that software development is rarely an isolated activity; it often requires clear communication, documentation, and collaboration, especially when working on larger or long term projects.

Over the course of the semester I am hoping to develop stronger skills in software architecture and large-scale system design. I also have never worked with others on an actual project so it will be quite a challenging but rewarding experience for the final project. Additionally, I have never really fully worked with implementing user interface (UI) elements in my code so that will be interesting this semester.

In the future, I hope to continue building projects that challenge me to learn new concepts while reinforcing effective coding practices. Whether through internships, team based projects, or personal projects, my goal for the future is to become a software engineer who can communicate effectively with others and contribute meaningfully to wherever I end up. In conclusion, I see software engineering as a complex but interesting learning oppurtunity in which this class can help me in developing my technical skills and ability to work within teams.
