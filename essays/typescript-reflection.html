    <h2>Introduction: A New Way to Code</h2>
    <p>When I first encountered TypeScript, I wondered why I should complicate my familiar JavaScript workflow. I had experience with JavaScript and Python, and while flexibility is convenient, it often leads to subtle bugs that are difficult to catch. TypeScript promised a way to write safer code while still working in the familiar JavaScript ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Learning TypeScript: Discovering Types</h2>
    <p>One of the first lessons I learned was the value of explicit types. Declaring interfaces, optional properties, and union types initially seemed verbose, but I quickly saw how they prevent runtime errors. For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
interface User {
  name: string;
  age?: number; // optional
}

function greet(user: User) {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}

const alice: User = { name: "Alice" };
console.log(greet(alice));
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this snippet, TypeScript ensures that every user object has a <code>name</code> property. Forgetting it triggers a compile-time error rather than causing unexpected behavior at runtime. Even with prior ES6 knowledge, I discovered new idioms like type guards, enums, and advanced union types, which make code more predictable and maintainable.</p>

    <h2>TypeScript in Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>From a software engineering perspective, TypeScript is a powerful tool. It acts as a safety net for large projects, reducing bugs and improving collaboration. While it requires additional setup compared to plain JavaScript, the trade-off is worthwhile: more maintainable code, clearer APIs, and fewer runtime surprises.</p>

    <h2>Athletic Software Engineering: Practicing the WODs</h2>
    <p>The practice “Workout of the Day” (WODs) pushed me to actively code under time constraints. Initially stressful, this style quickly became enjoyable as I noticed improvements in both speed and accuracy. Repetition, incremental difficulty, and immediate feedback make this “athletic” approach to learning highly effective for mastering TypeScript.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This module changed my perspective on JavaScript development. TypeScript isn’t just a stricter version of JavaScript—it is a professional tool for writing safer, more maintainable code. Coupled with athletic-style practice, I now feel confident in tackling larger projects and writing robust applications.</p>
