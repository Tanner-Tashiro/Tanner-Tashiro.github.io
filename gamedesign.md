During one summer break I focused on learning the fundamentals of game design and development using the Unity engine. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with sprites, basic physics, and interactive gameplay by building a small enrtry level game from scratch. Using Unity and C#, I explored how game objects, components, and scenes work together to create an interactive experience.

When first starting to learn Unity, I followed YouTube tutorials to recreate simple games such as "Flappy Bird", Tic tac toe, etc. Through these tutorials and practice I learned how to implement core gameplay mechanics such as player movement, collision detection, and basic game logic using C# scripts. Beyond technical skills, the project taught me how to break a large goal into manageable tasks and how experimentation and failure are an essential part of learning new development tools. I still have much to learn about game development and hope to learn 3D game design in the future.
