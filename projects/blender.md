summary: "During a summer break, I wanted to learn the basics on 3D modeling and how to use Blender."
---

I undertook a self-directed project to learn Blender, a professional 3D modeling and animation software, with the goal of creating a 3D scene from scratch. The project involved designing and modeling 3D objects, applying textures, experimenting with lighting, and setting up camera angles. This project allowed me to explore both the technical and artistic sides of 3D content creation. I followed various YouTube tutorials to gain some practice in using Blender.

Through this project, I developed strong problem-solving and self-directed learning skills, as I had to figure out complex features of Blender independently. I also gained hands-on experience in 3D modeling, animation principles, and digital asset management. Beyond technical skills, the project enhanced my creative thinking and attention to detail, demonstrating how persistence and experimentation lead to satisfactory results.
